## Instructions on How to Setup

First download and extract this repository to a local directory.

1. Add Nightbot to your channel if you haven't already: Use this link here.
https://beta.nightbot.tv/

2. Install the Custom Quote API system into your night bot by following these instructions
https://community.nightdev.com/t/customapi-quote-system/7871

3. Once you've done this you need to go to custom commands
https://beta.nightbot.tv/commands/custom
- Copy the token from the one that says !addquote. You will need this in the next command.

4. Create a new command called !wall (or !set your choice) and change the  permissions to everyone

5. Then change the command to this - make sure to replace [your token here] with your token remove square brackets [_]  --- >
```
$(urlfetch https://twitch.center/customapi/addquote?token=[your token here]&data=zzz$(userid))
```

6. You need to change [your token here] to the token value you copied in step 3 (note you must remove the square brackets too [_])

7. The last thing you'll need is a google api key follow these instructions:
  - https://www.slickremix.com/docs/get-api-key-for-youtube/
  - https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started
  - Make sure to enable Youtube Data API v3

8. Insert the nightbot token value (this is not the one from 3 but the one you'll find in !quote) and google api key in the config.js and you're good to go

9. You need to open the html file in notepad editor to be able to do this.

10. Run your command by visiting this link with your token inserted to check that the wall is working. ```https://twitch.center/customapi/addquote?token=[your token here]&data=zzzUCL3SkASCKgaXwIin7kwy6zA```

Hint replace
```[your token here]```

Enjoy
